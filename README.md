# TeamTask_UNICT

Steps to Start Up the Project

1. You must have installed a software that create a DB MySQL in local machine, such as Xampp and that MySQL is active.
2. You must start both projects: ServiceAPI (port: 5000) and SuperCoolApp (port:56000).
3. Make sure the above mentioned ports are available.
4. With the first startup, TeamTask tables will be created with pre-set test values. Be sure to remove the code lines from Program.cs after first running, for future launches.
5. As soon as the services are both running, go to http://localhost:56000 to show the project started.
